# Best Character: Arthur Morgan, Red Dead Redemption 2
## Rockstar Studios | October 26th, 2018 | PlayStation 4, Xbox One
### Runners-up: Atreus, God of War | Tsuyoshi Nagumo, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life

You're not supposed to like Arthur Morgan. Not at the beginning of _Red Dead Redemption 2_.

He's bland. He's milquetoast. He's not very interesting. In the game's first chapter, we're introduced to the Van der Linde gang as they flee to the remote winter wilderness. Arthur is little more than an emotional blank canvas that players initially use to complete the tutorial.

And yet, his transformation from loyal enforcer to conflicted moral authority throughout the game's six acts is a masterfully executed slow-burn payoff. Arthur isn't just the year's best character—he's the most grounded and relatable protagonist Rockstar has ever written.

Arthur's capacity for compassion and self-reflection is unearthed during a plot that—no spoilers, I promise—repeatedly forces him to brutally confront the choices that led him to anarchy. His stereotypical outlaw exterior is stretched to its breaking point by the love he lost, by the debtor who died by his hand—by the leader he can no longer follow.

All that Arthur was and believed in withers away in the game's sixth, and best, chapter. Where John Marston's redemption arc in the first game felt unearned, Arthur truly finds a path to redeem himself, or at least get very close to redemption. Even if you can't get into the game's opening chapters, it's worth sticking it out until Arthur's story concludes. We watch Arthur punch, spit, kick, and crawl forward in a rapidly civilizing world that no longer needs men like him, all while he tries his best to keep together a gang led by a father that no longer trusts him.

Early on, Dutch Van der Linde is lost in thought dreaming about an escape plan that, as we'd learn, would never come to fruition. Meanwhile, Arthur, who I chose to play honorably, was only ever focused on the safety and well-being of his adopted, misfit family. Arthur's charm slowly percolated to the top over the first five chapters of the game: his side-eyed looks at incestuous pig farmers, his singing during fishing trips, his surprising progressive attitude toward women suffragettes. The supreme voice acting by Roger Clark sells the internal conflict playing out across the 60-plus hours it takes to reach the credits.

When Arthur did a good deed, he was called a good man. But his life of crime was never far away. The Pinkerton Detective Agency, chasing them since the beginning of the game, had foiled every one of the gang's attempts to find peace. Arthur simply couldn't identify as a "good man" when federal stooges killed his closest friends in part because of crimes he helped commit.

Instead, knowing he was doomed to either die or face prison, Arthur did his best to amend each of his mistakes  across several states and dozens of side quests and dialogue choices.

Arguably, he failed. Arthur made little difference by the time the credits rolled: the civilizing industrialization of the 20th century still nipped at every outlaw's heels. There would be no refuge for Dutch's gang. They would each depart or die. Even so, Arthur was a relatable, troubled soul that guided me through the brutal old west of 1899. His incessant attempts to be better than his past, even when his life of danger and murder caught up to him at the end, will stick with me for a very long time. — _Aaron Thayer_

# Best Photo Mode: Assassin's Creed Odyssey
## Ubisoft Quebec | October 5, 2018 | PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One
### Runners-up: Marvel's Spider-Man | God of War

What makes a good photo mode? Some may prefer the nuance of tweaking f-stop, ISO, and exposure in a game like [_Gran Turismo Sport_](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2017/12/27/goty-2017-best-photo-mode), which offered the best damn photography simulation since the original _Dead Rising_. (He's covered wars, y'know.)

(Also, I'm kidding. _Dead Rising_ had a god-awful proto photo mode.)

Others, mirroring modern, mobile-first photography, would rather substitute technical accuracy for point-and-shoot simplicity. Specifically, they want something like _Marvel's Spider-Man_, where almost every shot looks as amazing as those heavily filtered food photos you post to Instagram on your $1200 iPhone.

If you're asking me, well, I'd rather visit an entire world with a trusty, albeit semi-adequate, camera. That's how I'd describe photographing the Mediterranean landscapes and city streets of _Assassin's Creed Odyssey_.

Last year we recognized _Gran Turismo Sport_ and its insane level of photographic detail. However, this year I (successfully) argued that we shouldn't only award games with the _most_ bells and whistles. I believe that a game world that offers the most variety of snappable subjects deserves top recognition, and _Odyssey_ is the closest I've seen to a living, breathing world that encourages exploration through a simulated lens.

Don't get me wrong: _Spider-Man_ makes for brilliant pictures. But _Odyssey_ is variety. Its small villages and bustling Athens offer almost limitless street photography compositions. As gorgeous as Spidey's New York is, that's all you get for the entire game: a big ol' city. _Odyssey_ gives you mountains, volcanos, the sea—all of it waiting to be captured with an admittedly decent proxy camera; the same one seen in last year's _Assassin's Creed Origins_.

But I'd argue again that the point of awarding "best photo mode" is not which game looked prettiest, and not which game offered the most menu sliders approximating real photography, but it's instead about spotlighting the game that encourages your artistic sensibilities with an unmatched living, breathing world of variety. Photography, to me, is about capturing moments I've never seen. Game photography is, to me, about capturing the essence of worlds that no longer or never will exist. No other game in 2018 approximated the IRL feeling of travelling to a beautiful country and making memories with your trusty camera. — _Aaron Thayer_

# Best Continuation: NEXT update, No Man's Sky
## Hello Games | July 24th, 2018 | PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One
### Runners-up: DELTARUNE | Prey: Mooncrash

This summer, nearly two years after receiving asinine death threats and shitty Steam reviews, Hello Games launched NEXT, its 1.5 update to _No Man's Sky_. Finally, the game was shaped into a state more closely resembling that [mind-blowing E3 2014 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLtmEjqzg7M).

Hype is a funny, fickle creature. "Gamers" were so thirsty for the version of _No Man's Sky_ they saw in trailers that, when the release product failed to meet those expectations, they revolted. They demanded. They threatened.

I don't envy Hello Games of the last two years. Whether or not Sean Murray is at fault for hooking his caboose to the hype train and getting gamers frothing over a product that could never meet their expectations is beside the point. Games are products, first and foremost, and they are designed amidst a modern backdrop of CI/CD: continuous improvement, continuous delivery. Incremental changes and tweaks should be expected. We're long past developers launching a perfect, bug-free game. Games, perhaps unfortunately, are as much a service in 2018 as are our paid apps and Blue Apron meal kits.

Or, actually, maybe "Games as a Service" isn't an unfortunate state for the industry. Because developers like Hello Games, if committed enough and if padded enough by capital reserves, can buckle down and work insanely hard to deliver the product they seemingly promised to deliver. Is this fair? Is expecting a form of servitude from developers until they "make it right" a logical evolution of customer entitlement? I don't think so, but I can't deny the improvements the NEXT update made to the core gameplay loops of _No Man's Sky_. Everything felt logical for the first time in the game's history. Gathering resources was no longer a complex math problem or tedious side job: it felt attainable and, surprisingly, rewarding.

Even though I didn't stick around long after NEXT launched, I sunk another 12 hours into a game I'd completely abandoned almost two years prior. If that's not the best continuation of 2018, and a testament to developers doing their damndest to payback the hype they built a half-decade earlier, well, I don't know what is. — _Aaron Thayer_

# Best Art Direction: Return of the Obra Dinn
## 3909 LLC | October 18th, 2018 | macOS, Windows
### Runners-up: Red Dead Redemption 2, Donut County

During our GOTY deliberations, Spencer said that _Return of the Obra Dinn_ absolutely nailed the monochromatic, 1-bit, dithered look of Macintosh classics from the 80s and 90s. I took him at his word.

See, I never had a Mac growing up, and I never played games on one. I have zero nostalgia for graphical style framing Lucas Pope's follow-up to _Papers, Please_.

How is it, then, that a visual approximation of an era and platform I've never experienced feels absolutely quintessential to the enjoyment of _Obra Dinn_?

From screenshots, I can understand that the average person might think the game is all style, no substance. I was worried about that, too. In its first reveal, _Obra Dinn_ just looked like it was trying too hard to be different. Choosing a drastically different look for a project invites the uninitiated to cast aspersions over the merits of the entire end product—which isn't news to any of you creators out there. So, I cast my aspersions. Later, I'd find out I was really, truly wrong about the game's look, and learn that despite my doubts, _Obra Dinn_ succeeded because of the way it looks.

What's so brilliant about Pope's design choice is that he simultaneously sells the insurance adjuster murder mystery plot—which I can't imagine would've worked were _Obra Dinn_ designed in Unreal 4—while reminding us that games don't have to be visually binary. They don't _have_ to be either photorealistic or pixelated. To my eye, the games industry has steadily shifted toward artistic homogenization in the last decade, whether we're examining an independently designed early access game or a major release in a massive console franchise. It sometimes feels like every game is made with, well, take your pick: cutesy, hand-drawn illustration; blocky, retro-chic pixel art; Minecraft-lite voxel blocks; or insanely detailed, boundary-pushing 3D graphics. As an art form, games have recently leaned a bit too heavily on their commercial nature. Trends speak to sales estimates, so it's no wonder there's not much middle-ground for developers big and small struggling to achieve profitability: so, you design what you know will sell. That mentality leaves little room for the innovators, the boundary-pushers.

Or, I guess there's just enough room for creatives like Lucas Pope. _Return of the Obra Dinn_ reminds us that games are made _from nothing_—they can be _anything_. Aside from its mind-bending logic puzzles, which are told against a plot that marries Jules Verne with _Masterpiece Theatre_, the soul of _Obra Dinn_ is in its look. It's clean, it's old, it's modern, it's refreshing. More than any other game this year, of which there are many beautiful ones, including our runners-up, _Return of the Obra Dinn_ can stand as a proud example for the industry: a game's success and peerless execution need not be anchored to predetermined, popular aesthetics.

If the creative mind is set free to wander, it can produce amazing results that, hopefully, wake up an entire industry to the reality that it can do so much more with the tools, and imagination, it has. — _Aaron Thayer_
