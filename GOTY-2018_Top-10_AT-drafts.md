# \#5 – _God of War_
## Sony Santa Monica | April 24th, 2018 | PlayStation 4

Even now, months after finishing the soft reboot of a franchise I once begrudgingly played, I find it hard to believe that this new version of Kratos exists.

Not (five) years ago was I forced to watch Kratos gouge out Poseidon's eyes...from Poseidon's perspective. Those of us who remember the first _God of War_ remember a series born of excess, of viscera, of, in retrospect, snuff-film tendencies. In 2005, that was daring enough to win over a core gamer crowd desperate for so-called "mature" experiences. For a long time, Kratos was happy to oblige.

But not long after the series hit its stride, it peaked. By the time we were forcing our thumbs into Poseidon's eye sockets, _God of War_ had become a stale proposition. Its most shockingly base proclivities felt tired. Rendering gore for the sake of gore had rapidly moved past annotating maturity for thin plots and weak premises. Maybe I'm projecting in the retrospective, but I'm sure all but the diehard fans with their awful Kratos body tattoos were ready to put the franchise to bed. An incessant barrage of middling prequels and side stories didn't do much to keep _God of War_ relevant, and it quickly fell to the wayside, no longer a top tier mascot for the "mature" gaming console. And yet, had Kratos not been mothballed and failed to stay relevant, I don't think the new direction the series has taken would have ever been possible.

The latest _God of War_ is the best the franchise has ever been, even looking back at the first game and experiencing its precision combat mechanics at a time when action games were still hit-or-miss. There's no comparison to the first three games. This is the best version of Kratos we've ever played.

That Sony Santa Monica made me give a shit about Kratos on a human level is a feat worth celebrating. The game's script, a coming-of-age father and son adventure written by (NAME), treads similar ground to other dark, brooding, psychological examinations of the relationship between a parent and child amidst extraordinary circumstances. We've seen this play out in films like _The Road_ and even game contemporaries like _The Last of Us_. In fact, I had little hope for the new _God of War_ after seeing its initial reveal trailer: The shoulder camera and child NPC screamed Sony trying to crib from the successful elements that made Joel and Ellie such a memorable duo. However, throughout the game, I was simply blown away by the Kratos and his son Atreus' believable and heartfelt grappling with what it means to be a god in a world where all you want is to find peace and atonement for the vengeful life you once led.

A tight script and refreshing change of scenery wastes little space and offers an entirely new feel. Mimir is a headless Norse god that accompanies the dysfunctional family while being the best damn game codex I've ever seen.

The combat is slow and methodical in the first half of the game due to the Leviathan axe, replacing Kratos' Chaos Blades. The combat matches the slow, introspective plot. It encourages us to play a Kratos who breathes, who pauses, who hesitates. He's no longer the former Spartan who blindly charges into battle to spill blood—in fact he tries to avoid it at all costs, until he's pressed to defend himself and Atreus.

Honestly, the combat is just fine. It's not the main draw. Neither is the gorgeous art direction and extremely crisp fidelity. They're expected components of a major AAA release. What makes _God of War_ one of the best games of the year is its dedication to reinvention. Reinventing and subverting every expectation we have of a famously profitable franchise is an undertaking few would volunteer for. That Sony Santa Monica was courageous enough to reinvent its wheel, _and_ succeed in doing so? It makes _God of War_ perhaps the most remarkable game to ever successfully reinvent itself
