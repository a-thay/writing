# \#5 – _God of War_
## SIE Santa Monica Studio | April 20th, 2018 | PlayStation 4

Even now, months after finishing the soft reboot of a franchise I'd almost entirely written off, I find it hard to believe that this new, sanded-down version of Kratos exists. The last time I embodied the titular God of War, I'd had more than my fill of sophomoric violence and the incessant, paper-thin revenge plot.

Almost a decade ago, in _God of War III_, I was forced to watch Kratos dig his thumbs into Poseidon's eye sockets—a scene mostly shot in first person, with the player looking through Poseidon's eyes the moment until his death. That fight, and the entire game, was pure excess. It had nothing to say about, let alone justify, its protagonist's penchant for violence other than: "You thought the previous games were violent? Hold my beer."

Those of us who remember the first _God of War_ remember a series born of excess, of viscera, of, in retrospect, snuff. In 2005, that was daring enough to win over a core gamer crowd desperate for so-called "mature" experiences.

But five short years after its debut, the franchise peaked. Its most shocking and base proclivities had become exhausting to all but the most diehard fans.

In so many words, the franchise was overdue for a mothballing by its third entry. Even after Kratos' story had seemingly ended, an incessant barrage of middling prequels and side stories didn't succeed in keeping _God of War_ relevant, and after 2010, it quickly fell off the industry's radar. Kratos was no longer a top-tier mascot for the "mature" PlayStation brand.

But here we are. The 2018 version of _God of War_ is the best of the franchise: a testament to "killing your darlings," an adage encouraging creators to be unafraid to challenge, tweak, and even destroy their most beloved ideas. Director Cory Balrog was given a completely clean slate to revitalize Kratos, and he took complete advantage of that freedom to make us give a shit about a one-note character.

That Balrog and Santa Monica Studio focused not on mechanics, but on narrative, is a feat worth celebrating. Kratos is more human—more relatable. He's a bit wrinkled. He's slower. His beard is flecked with grey hairs. He's once again a father, this time in an unexpected coming-of-age adventure expertly written by Balrog, Matt Sophos, and Richard Zangrande Gaubert. And while the plot treads similar ground to other dark, brooding, psychological examinations of a parent and child thrust into extraordinary circumstances, the trope breathes new life into the franchise here. Even the best examples of these themes—think _The Road_ and contemporaries like _The Last of Us_—haven't dealt with a human-turned-god-turned-father dynamic.

I was simply blown away by Kratos and his son Atreus' believable and heartfelt grappling with what it means to be a god in a world where all you want is to find peace and atonement for the vengeful life you once led. A tight script and refreshing change of scenery wastes little space and offers an electric new take on well-tread ground.

The combat is slow and methodical in the first half of the game due to the Leviathan axe, replacing Kratos' Chaos Blades. The combat matches the slow, introspective plot. It encourages us to play a Kratos who breathes, who pauses, who hesitates. He's no longer the former Spartan who blindly charges into battle to spill blood—in fact he tries to avoid it at all costs, until he's pressed to defend himself and Atreus.

Honestly, the combat is just fine. It's not the main draw. Neither is the gorgeous art direction and extremely crisp fidelity. They're expected components of a major AAA release. What makes _God of War_ one of the best games of the year is its dedication to reinvention. Reinventing and subverting every expectation we have of a famously profitable franchise is an undertaking few would volunteer for. That Sony Santa Monica was courageous enough to reinvent its wheel, _and_ succeed in doing so? It makes _God of War_ perhaps the most remarkable game to ever successfully reinvent itself. —_Aaron Thayer_


# \#3 – _Return of the Obra Dinn_
## 3909 LLC | October 18th, 2018 | macOS, Windows

What a brilliant game.

Its [art direction](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2018/12/30/goty-2018-best-art-direction) is noteworthy, yes, but overall success is born from Lucas Pope's meticulous, singular vision. He set out to create a 19th-century insurance adjusting murder mystery, and that's exactly what he released.

If you take a gander at [old screenshots from 2014](https://games.avclub.com/do-you-practice-the-art-of-in-game-photography-1798273342), the game seems barely any different than it did four years later. The concept was crystal clear, even back then. Which proves that all those years of development were used to polish, tighten, and perfect its mechanics.

Beyond the graphics, _Obra Dinn_ is one big logic grid. Whereas other similar games like _The Witness_ barely kept me engaged and made me feel overwhelmed, or even stupid, _Obra Dinn_ does a masterful job of make its carrot-on-the-stick mysteries seem attainable. Which they are. Eventually I _did_ grab each and every carrot, albeit after hours of writing down paper notes and cross-checking my adjustor's in-game journal.

Maybe its formula succeeds because of that uncompromising vision. Or, maybe it's so unique, so _weird_ and unexpected, that I happily bought what it was selling without question. Actually, I think I loved _Obra Dinn_ because it made me feel smart.

The games industry needs fiercely original IP. (It also needs diversity, of all kinds, but original ideas are also lacking.) Thematically, _Obra Dinn_ doesn't ask much of its players, and it doesn't have much of a statement to make—other than, I suppose, a lovely feature that [randomizes the gender of your protagonist each time you start a new game](https://twitter.com/dukope/status/1052971831655727104). Even so, _Return of the Obra Dinn_ is exactly what it needed to be: a celebration of minimalism, an ode to the most miniscule of details...a shining example that game developers can do so much more with so much less.

# \#1 – _Celeste_ (contribution)

# Aaron

I'll remember _Celeste_ as the game that gave me back a little bit of hope amidst ongoing darkness.

January of 2018 wasn't a great time for me and mine. Things are better now, a bit, but my wife and I were still deep in the middle of various personal crises that began in 2017. And separate from that, I was stressed out by my new job as a contractor (read: few benefits and far less pay) and the daily breaking news stories flowing from the broken sewage pipe we call the White House. (An administration that, expectedly, hasn't improved at all over the past year.)

I had barely touched a controller in weeks. I couldn't be bothered to turn on a console because none of it mattered. In retrospect, I was depressed.

So, there I am a year ago, flailing around inside an emotional maelstrom where videogames were the absolute lowest priority. I recall the sunken feeling of trying to start _Persona 5_ and thinking that it, and all games, were a complete waste of time. My well of joy had run dry.

Considering my state, why would I want to play a hardcore platformer from the _Towerfall_ developer, a game I sucked at and thereby sorta hated? There was no way, I thought, I'd ever finish _Celeste_. It looked pretty, but it seemed like _Celeste_ was destined to be deleted from my Switch forever—just like when I gave up on _Super Meat Boy_ and a half-dozen other difficult platformers over the years.

Then, one weekend morning after _Celeste_ released, I grabbed my Switch, popped in my earbuds, and started a new game. I don't even remember what motivated me to do it.

I beat the first screen, easily. Then I died once or twice on the next few screens. I died again, quite a few more times on another screen, missing a pretty simple wall jump until I understood what the game was asking of me. It wanted me to be patient and persistent. It wanted me to slow down, focus, and respect myself, even when I inevitably failed.

While I was figuring out the mechanics through trial-and-error, I didn't realize that all the deaths, all those failures, didn't piss me off.

> What _Celeste_ taught me is that I could find a way out of the darkness. I could, if I kept pushing myself, climb that physical mountain as well as the metaphorical one.

Historically—and I'm embarrassed to admit this—I have a pretty short fuse when it comes to difficult games. It's why, since _A Link to the Past_, I've gravitated toward RPGs. In my childhood, my active imagination soaked up every sword, spell, and dragon from my favorite SNES games. As an adult, I kept indulging in digital role-play to escape from reality, which was (and is) a constant fucking struggle.

(That _I'm_ saying life is hard, as a privileged white male from an upper-middle-class family, is an absurdity that is absolutely not lost on me. But on a general level, we all agree that being an adult is often a shitty experience, yes?)

Basically, I didn't want games to challenge me. I wanted them to tell a great story while being surmountable. I never looked at games as a mountain to climb, which is a metaphor typically reserved for life, until I played _Celeste_.

I could write about its pixel-perfect platforming or its addictive soundtrack, but those were byproducts of the core experience. What _Celeste_ taught me is that I could find a way out of the darkness. I could, if I kept pushing myself, climb that physical mountain as well as the metaphorical one.


Maybe I'm giving the game too much credit. But, coincidentally or not, after I persevered and beat its A-side levels, things in the real world started to improve. My job brought me on as a full-time employee. My wife and I began to navigate our loss and chart a path forward. The President was impeached. (Sigh.)

Or maybe _Celeste_ did teach me something at the exact moment I needed to be taught. After experiencing the depths of tragedy and despair, a pixelized platformer brought me so much joy through its journey up the mountain. I was ready to climb my way up my own mountain too, and I'll always have a soft spot for what it taught me. — _Aaron Thayer_
