Ten years ago today, Silicon Sasquatch posted its first article. You can still view Nick's inaugural "[This week in music gaming](https://siliconsasquatch.wordpress.com/2008/12/20/this-week-in-music-gaming/)" on our original WordPress domain.

Wow. We've been at this shit for a decade!

Since that first post, we: wrote a [book](http://www.blurb.com/b/1792816-silicon-sasquatch-the-first-year-or-so); launched three [podcasts](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/podcasts/); hosted [several](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2013/12/29/being-escorted-in-a-videogame-heres-how-not-to-die) [talented](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2017/12/20/guest-list-charlene-putneys-top-games-of-2017) [contributors](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2016/12/19/goty-2016-guest-list-dan-phipps-top-10-games-of-2016), interviewed some of our [favorite](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2016/11/23/interview-dan-teasdale-and-heather-wilson-of-harmonix-music-systems) [game](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2014/09/30/chatting-with-samantha-kalman-and-solon-scott) [developers](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2013/09/25/interview-steve-gaynor-of-the-fullbright-company?rq=interview); wrestled back control of our domain from (presumably) [Russian hackers](http://siliconsasquatch.tumblr.com/post/23097738233/lets-talk-about-what-happened-to-the-blog-part-3); ceased publication not [once](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2011/07/24/sorry), not [twice](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2012/11/05/a-year-of-disruption), but [thrice](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2015/04/27/so-long); and, perhaps most notably, posted [nine Game of the Year features](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/goty/) comprising hundreds of hours of unpaid work entirely fueled by our love of the medium and a dark desire to yell at each other.

Five years ago today we posted "[The 5th Anniversarycast](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2013/12/20/the-5th-anniversarycast-silicon-sasquatch-podcast-episode-32)." Nick, Doug, Spencer, and I talked about our strange-yet-rewarding foray into journalism, five years on. We discussed the birth of Silicon Sasquatch, to which Nick memorably said: "Like all bad ideas, it came from World of Warcraft." It's a lovely retrospective chat, and I recommend you listen to it.

Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to quote myself a bit for the remainder of this celebration. Marquee anniversaries like this don't often come along, which says a lot about our perseverance and outright stubbornness to keep the lights on despite attempting to kill our joint endeavor numerous times. The point is: a little self-indulgence is allowed!

The two excerpts below I wrote in April 2015, when we thought we'd shut down the blog for good, and in September 2016, when I posted my first article since ceasing publication. Reading my own words again, I can now see I never actually intended to stop Silicon Sasquatch. The blog was never far away from my mind, albeit shoved into a corner, gathering dust for awhile. See what I mean:

> When *Electronic Gaming Monthly*, my standard-bearer for fun and fascinating games writing, shutdown mere months into our website's existence, it should have told me we were going to have a rough go of things. I idolized it and the games journalism of the 1990s and early 2000s, and not because I thought a career covering video games was cool and a way to get out of a real job. Rather, I (secretly) saw myself bringing real journalistic ethics and style to an industry that seemed to write too much about the glamor, flash and swag shoveled by game publishers on a daily basis. And for a long time I silently blamed our team's lack of success, however I defined that at any given time, on "the market" or "gamers" themselves—that they just didn't "get" what we were doing. I realize now, after countless heartfelt discussions about the organization's direction and purpose, that it was unfair to hold anyone but myself responsible for what I expected to achieve with Silicon Sasquatch. We were never built to be a professional (read: revenue-generating) business venture, which is perfectly OK! It just took the reality of discussing our end to understand our limitations, and to accept them. I only wish I'd realized it sooner.

That doesn't sound like someone ready to quit. If anything, I was finally waking up to our potential once I stopped trying to live the fantasy of "professional games journalist" and found the real reasons why I stayed involved in Silicon Sasquatch. These reasons wouldn't completely coalesce until I wrote my first piece back:

> ...My own reasons [for returning] aren’t complicated. I missed writing. I missed creating. My day job is filled with challenges and problem solving and has flexed career muscles I didn’t think I had, but it’s not “writing” in a pure sense. After we stopped the blog I earned a master’s degree in professional and technical writing, and I’m thankful my work affords me the opportunity to pursue that as a career. It just doesn’t scratch every creative itch I have. And, after talking about it with the staff, it seemed like many of us missed the act of creation, too.

So here we are, a decade later. We quit three times yet we're all still doing the damn thing, despite how much has changed.

We have full-time jobs. Two of us are married. Some of us were laid-off within the last year, while one of us took big steps toward his dream career. We've each experienced tragedy and triumph since December 20, 2008. Through all of life's turns, we've had this site: our reason to talk about games, and, on occasion, to write about them.

Maybe we haven't always given the blog our best efforts. I know I haven't. Even so, it continues to bring five opinionated, wholly different people together on a daily basis. Nick and I started this venture as schoolmates. Later, I'd think of us as coworkers. Eventually, we became friends. I knew Doug from the dorms, but I don't think I truly understood him until we worked together. And over the last 10 years I've built important friendships with Spencer and Tyler, who I've only seen in person a handful of times.

Games were our shared interest and the glue that first bound us together. We always respected each other as creators. Eventually we respected each other as friends.

That's not to say we don't fight or argue. We're our own strange little family, and families fight. But rather than simply endure each other, or walk away entirely, we keep choosing to work on this blog, together.

Like with any family, it's difficult to predict how each of us will grow and change over the _next_ 10 years. Even if Silicon Sasquatch doesn't survive, and there's not a 15th or 20th anniversary post following this one, I'm beyond proud that we've made it this far.

Happy 10th anniversary to us!
