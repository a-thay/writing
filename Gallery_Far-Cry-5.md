Very few games compel me to play tourist in real life.

Usually I'm blasting off into space, or [galloping across ancient Egypt](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/blog/2018/6/9/gallery-parting-shots-of-assassins-creed-origins), or going almost anywhere other than contemporary America. I rarely arrive at a digitized landscape and leave with a travel itinerary.

But some games choose to redesign real places. And, as exaggerated as these interpretations may be, some are compelling travel adsâ€”as I type, I'm looking at my [travel poster for a fake version of a real state](https://store.camposanto.com/products/firewatch-print-set).

_Firewatch_ and its stylized Wyoming was the first game to make me consider its subject matter a worthy destination. I have no idea how accurate Campo Santo made the trees and deer, but the golden sky casting long rays of light across sparkling lakes and towering firs paint [the Equality State](https://www.bustle.com/articles/153189-wyomings-nickname-shouldnt-be-the-equality-state-anymore-after-forgetting-its-womens-history) as a grand, wild adventure where the sun never sets.

I've yet to go, but Wyoming is certainly on my bucket list.

Then there's _Far Cry 5_, a game more notable for its breathtaking amalgamation of Montana than its [disappointing, "many sides" plot](https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/27/17165252/far-cry-5-story-characters).

Hiking through the fictional Hope County, Montana takes me back to similar trails around Bend, Oregon: feeling the summer sun on my arms; smelling that familiar mixture of pine and warm earth; hearing bird calls and the constant babbling of a nearby stream.

With so much programmed beauty, it's impossible to take a bad screenshot. However, I'll note that these pictures were taken before [Ubisoft added a full photo mode](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Faqs/000035618).

I've yet to go back and experiment with better photo tools. Honestly, I doubt I will. I'd rather leave Ubisoft's version of the state behind and, instead, promise to take my camera to the real Montana someday.

Enjoy.
